### 👋 Hello there!

I'm Canberk — a curious coder who enjoys building, breaking, and fixing things (in that order).  
I work with **Java**, **Bash**, and a bit of everything else that sounds interesting.

🔧 **What I do:**

- 💻 Write clean code and occasionally elegant bugs  
- 🔐 Love cryptology documentaries, optimising algorithms, and the art of problem-solving  
- 🐧 Linux enjoyer 
- 🎮 Gamer on the side — into RPG games and indie games  
- ☕ Fuelled by coffee, curiosity, and lots of trial-and-error

🧰 **Tech toolbox:**

`Java` • `Python` • `PostgreSQL` • `Linux` • `Git` • `VS Code` • `Bash` • `Docker`
